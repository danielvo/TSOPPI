**Sample data post-processing** tool
====================================

**Under construction..**

About
-----
Separate analysis pipelines are run by the LocalApp software for DNA and RNA samples,
generating:

- quality control (QC) metrics for both sample types;
- fusion and splice variant output for RNA samples;
- small variant output, copy number variant
  output (*CNV*) and microsatellite status (MS status) information for DNA samples.

However, LocalApp analyzes all samples independently, and no difference is made
between tumor and normal DNA samples.
The aims of the "process_patient_samples" TSOPPI tool are to:

- integrate data generated for matched samples of a given patient
  (tumor DNA and/or normal DNA and/or tumor RNA);
- aggregate information spread over multiple LocalApp output files, include
  information from external resources and tie together data available for the
  different variant types;
- normalize and visualize CNV-related data;
- annotate and prioritize small variants called by the LocalApp;
- assist with sample QC, as well as variant QC and interpretation.

Notes regarding small variant terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Small variants passing all of LocalApp's technical quality filters, such as coverage and support,
are in the post-processing divided into 4 classes, which are being referred to
throughout the TSOPPI output files:

- **BL**: variants located within regions blacklisted in the LocalApp due to
  background noise levels;
- **GL_DB**: variants present in LocalApp's internal germline databases
  (i.e, having allele count â‰¥10 in any of LocalApp's GnomAD exome, GnomAD genome
  and 1000 genomes database);
- **GL_P**: variants assumed to be "germline by proximity" according to LocalApp
  (i.e., having allelic fractions similar to those of known germline variants
  present on the same chromosome);
- **SOM**: the remaining variants (not having been filtered, these are assumed to be somatic).

TSO500 small variants include:

- single nucleotide variants (SNVs): single-base substitutions;
- multiple nucleotide variants (MNVs): block substitutions;
- insertions/deletions (INDELs) of limited size (up to about 25 bp).

Functionality overview
----------------------
.. image:: images/process_patient_samples_tool_overview.png

The tool's functionality is broken down into multiple blocks, which are
enabled/disabled based on the parameter settings and the combination of available
patient samples (any combination of tumor DNA, normal DNA and tumor RNA samples
is allowed on input).

Please note that some TSOPPI-generated files (especially
intermediate outputs) are not listed in the *Input files* sections below.

.. _S1-label:

1. Meta-information & sample-wise metrics

.. _S3-label:

3. Small variant aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Enabled by default, triggered by tumor DNA sample, utilizing all available
samples.**

**Functionality:** Aggregating small variant information from multiple LocalApp
output files (per sample). Aggregating tumor DNA and normal DNA small variant data,
investigating the support for tumor DNA variants in the tumor RNA sample. Creating
small variant overview tables and allelic fraction histograms/scatter plots.
Calculating tumor DNA/normal DNA and tumor DNA/tumor RNA sample concordance
based on known germline variant support. Creating PCGR-/CPRS-ready VCF files.
Creating a mutational signature plot (plotting variant counts for all possible
substitution types and their and 3-bp genomic contexts;
not a mutational signature decomposition analysis).

**Input files:**

- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/VariantMatching/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID]_MergedSmallVariants.genome.vcf"
  files for input DNA samples (located automatically);
- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/Tmb/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID]_TMB_Trace.tsv"
  file for input tumor DNA sample (located automatically);
- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/RnaMarkDuplicates/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID].bam"
  file for input tumor RNA sample (located automatically);
- a reference fasta file supplied via the *--reference_fasta_file* option.

**Output files:**

- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variant_AF_plots.pdf" - allelic fraction (AF) distribution
  plots for the individual classes of small variants (BL, GL_DB, GL_P, SOM) -
  scatter plots of normal DNA sample is available, histograms otherwise;
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_sample_concordance.tsv" - tumor DNA/normal DNA and tumor DNA/tumor RNA
  sample concordances based on small variant presence and AF values - format
  details and variant inclusion criteria are listed in the file header;

  counts by class and type (SNVs, MNVs, INDELs);
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variants_all.vcf" - a PCGR-/CPSR-ready VCF file
  including all small variants classified as BL, GL_DB, GL_P or SOM;
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variants_somatic.vcf" - a PCGR-/CPSR-ready VCF file
  with likely somatic variants (if a normal DNA sample is available, this
  encompasses all variants with tumor DNA sample AF at least 5 times higher than
  the normal DNA sample AF; if a normal DNA sample is not available,
  all SOM class variants are included instead);
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_joint_mutational_signature.pdf"
  (as described in the functionality paragraph above).

Additional notes:

- When available, the tumor RNA sample will be checked for support of small
  variants called in the tumor DNA sample. As of TSOPPI v0.3, it is not checked
  whether locations of the individual variants are covered by the TSO500 RNA assay.
- As a consequence of different read mapping software being used for the DNA and
  RNA samples, some variants (especially complex variants and INDELs in certain
  genomic areas) might be reported differently for DNA and RNA samples (even
  despite variant format normalization included in TSOPPI). It is thus strongly
  recommended to manually check the RNA support of all critically important small
  variants.

.. _S4-label:

4. PCGR/CPSR annotation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Enabled by default, triggered by tumor DNA sample, utilizing available DNA
samples.**

**Functionality:** Annotation of all BL, GL_DB, GL_P and SOM variants found in
the DNA tumor sample with information necessary for interpretation in precision
medicine setting. Annotation of non-reference variants with regard to cancer
predisposition (run on normal DNA sample data when available, and on tumor DNA
sample data otherwise). (Please refer to the official
`PCGR <https://github.com/sigven/pcgr>`_/`CPSR <https://github.com/sigven/cpsr>`_
resources for details regarding the software's implementation and functionality.)

**Input files:**

- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variants_all.vcf",
  "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variants_somatic.vcf" and an intermediate CPSR-ready
  non-reference variant VCF file, all generated during the *small variant aggregation*
  step as described above.

  generated with options "--show_noncoding", "--assay TARGETED", "--include_trials";
- Directory "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_PCGR_0.9.1_mutational_signatures" - PCGR annotation
  output for variants present in file "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variants_somatic.vcf",
  with an additional mutational signature analysis enabled (only executed if the
  input file contains >= 100 SNVs); generated with options "--show_noncoding",

  sample (or the normal DNA sample, if available); generated with options
  "--panel_id 0", "--secondary_findings", "--classify_all", "--gwas_findings".

.. _S5-label:

5. Small variant prioritization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Enabled by default, triggered by tumor DNA sample, utilizing all available
samples.**

**Functionality:** Selection of small variants potentially relevant for cancer
diagnostics and treatment. Integration of LocalApp and PCGR/CPSR annotation
resources with other information (InPreD small variant recurrence data,
CN values and FoundationOne Liquid CDx targets).

**Input files:**

- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/Annotation/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID]_SmallVariants_Annotated.json.gz"
  file for input tumor DNA sample (located automatically);
- "\*.pcgr_acmg.grch37.snvs_indels.tiers.tsv" and "\*.pcgr_acmg.grch37.pass.tsv.gz"
  files from the "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_PCGR_0.9.1_all" directory generated by PCGR
  (see the :ref:`S4-label` section for details);
- "\*.cpsr.grch37.snvs_indels.tiers.tsv" and "\*.cpsr.grch37.pass.tsv.gz" files
  from the CPSR output directory (see the :ref:`S4-label` section for details);
- A range of files generated by TSOPPI in previous analysis steps, particularly
  outputs related to small variants and CNVs.
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/F1LCDx_genes.tsv";
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/blacklisted_variants.tsv";
- (optional) variant recurrence table generated by the
  :doc:`variant recurrence table update </variant_recurrence_table_creation>` tool.

**Output files:**

- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variant_table.tsv" - aggregated information about
  small variants with potential relevance for cancer diagnostics and treatment
  (please see the file header for details regarding the output format and variant
  inclusion criteria);
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variant_table_blacklisted.tsv" - aggregated information
  about small variants that fulfill criteria for inclusion in the
  "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variant_table.tsv" file, but which are observed too
  often to be relevant (please see the notes below);
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_predisposition_gene_variant_table_\*.tsv" - an overview of
  small variants located within cancer predisposition genes defined in a dedicated
  `ESMO paper <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31050713/>`_;
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variant_overview_by_tier.tsv" - a breakdown of variant
  counts by class and PCGR-reported ACMG/AMP-based tier.

Additional notes:

- An internal TSOPPI file (/inpred/resources/blacklisted_variants.tsv) decides
  by default which variants will be redirected to the blacklist variant table
  output. This file currently lists only variants appearing with >= 35 % VAF
  support in at least 50 % of OUS-investigated InPreD tumor samples (when only
  considering samples in which the variant position is callable).
- An own blacklist definition file can be supplied via this tool's parameter
  "--inpred_small_variant_blacklist". Values in the first column of non-commented
  lines in the supplied blacklist definition file will be interpreted as variant
  IDs in format "chromosome:position:reference_allele>alternative_allele"
  (using 1-based positions, e.g. "8:145738767:CG>C"); any additional columns
  will be ignored during the processing.
- Much of the information provided in the output variant tables is tied to primary
  Ensembl transcripts, which are determined for individual variants by
  `VEP <https://grch37.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html>`_
  during the PCGR/CPSR annotation. Information about variants' notable protein
  coding consequences in other transcripts (whether Ensembl or RefSeq), as
  reported by LocalApp's Nirvana, can be found in the "Coding_transcript_consequences"
  column of the two "\*small_variant_table\*" output files.

.. _S6-label:

6. IGV-links generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Enabled by default, triggered by tumor DNA sample, utilizing all available
samples.**

**Functionality:** Creation of HTML files simplifying variant QC in IGV by single-click
BAM file loading and variant loci hopping. Own variant files are created for
each user specified via the "--port_number_labels" parameter, allowing for
parallel use by multiple users on the same machine (reserving a different IGV
communication port for each user).

**Input files:**

- "\*.pcgr_acmg.grch37.snvs_indels.tiers.tsv" file from the
  "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_PCGR_0.9.1_all" directory generated by PCGR
  (see the :ref:`S4-label` section for details);
- TSOPPI-generated "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variant_table.tsv" file (described above).

**Output files:**

- A set of "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_IGV_links_all_variants.port_[Number]_[Label].html" files
  generated for all port Number and Label value pairs determined by the
  "--initial_port_number" and "--port_number_labels" tool parameters. IGV links
  for all BL, GL_DB, GL_P and SOM variants are included in this output file.
- A set of "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_IGV_links_interpretation_table_variants.port_[Number]_[Label].html" files
  generated for all port Number and Label value pairs determined by the
  "--initial_port_number" and "--port_number_labels" tool parameters. Only IGV links
  for variants present in the "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_small_variant_table.tsv"
  file are included in this output.

Additional notes:

- Besides HTML links that allow directly jumping into genomic loci of the
  individual variants within IGV, all output files also provide links for IGV
  session initialization/reset and for loading of relevant patient bam files.
  The tool parameter "--igv_session_file [path]" needs to be supplied in order
  to specify path to a standard IGV session file. Paths to the following BAM files
  are automatically determined and included:

  - "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/StitchedRealigned/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID].bam"
    file paths for input DNA samples (these are the files on which small variant
    calling is performed by the LocalApp);
  - "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/DnaRealignment/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID].bam"
    file paths for input DNA samples (these are BAM files with separate R1 and R2 sequences);
  - "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/RnaMarkDuplicates/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID].bam"
    file for input tumor RNA sample.

.. _S7-label:

7. CNV plotting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Enabled by default, triggered by tumor DNA sample, utilizing all available
samples.**

**Functionality:** Creation of plots aimed for helping with copy number change
interpretation. Gene-wise CNVs and variant AFs plotted on gene, chromosome and
sample level.

**Input files:**

- TSOPPI-generated file "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_merged_CNV_data.tsv" (see the :ref:`S2-label` section for details);
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/centromere_data/hg19_chromosome_sizes.tsv";
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/merged_normal_sample_CNV_data.tsv";
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/PAR_genes.tsv".

**Output files:**

- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_CNV_overview_plots.pdf" - CNV plots on
  sample/genome and chromosome level, including variant AF plots and
  gene CNV plots for the available samples;
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_CNV_distribution_plots.pdf" - gene-level plots showing
  CN values observed in the available DNA samples in the context of a CN value
  distribution within a group of unrelated normal samples.

Additional notes:

- The *\*CNV_overview_plots.pdf* document is divided into four sections, with
  the plots within each section being marked by unique title prefixes
  ("[An]", "[Bn]", "[Cn]", "[Dna]"/"[Dnb]"). Depending on whether normal DNA
  and/or tumor RNA samples are included in the analysis, some plots might not be
  generated. Specific page numbers might therefore show different plot types
  for different patients. A given title prefix will however always mark the same
  plot type.
- Please note that the "[C3]"-prefixed plot is different from the remaining "[Cn]"
  plots: the x-axis value on this plot represents the variant order rather than
  genomic position. The relative width of each chromosome on the "C3"-plot is thus
  determined by per-chromosome variant counts rather than chromosome lengths.
  This plot should allow for better visual evaluation of possible contamination
  issues (variant clusters forming vertical bars on other "Cn" plots should be
  stretched out into larger areas on this plot, potentially revealing breakpoints
  with visible AFs jumps).
- The *\*CNV_distribution_plots.pdf* document shows for each gene what its CN
  value distribution is in normal samples (i.e., samples in which frequent CN
  changes are not expected), both before and after adjustment to the tumor
  content value estimated for given tumor DNA sample.
  It can help answer the following questions:

  - Does the LocalApp tend to systematically over- or under-estimate the CN value
    for given gene?
  - How wide/narrow is the CN value distribution for given gene?

  A certain CN value might be a clear outlier for one gene, while being well
  within the expected "normal" range for another gene. The displayed percentile
  information should provide an objective measure of how (un)likely a given CN
  value that was observed in a patient's DNA sample is to be observed in (mostly)
  CN-neutral samples.

.. _S8-label:

8. Sequencing artifact assessment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Disabled by default, triggered by tumor DNA sample if the "--enable_CSAM_check"
option is set to "True", utilizing only the DNA tumor sample.**

**Functionality:** Utilizing the `Picard tools (v2.26.2) <https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/>`_
to determine the presence of sequencing artifacts (oxidation and/or deamination
in particular).

**Input files:**

- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/DnaRealignment/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID].bam"
  file for tumor DNA sample (located automatically);
- a reference fasta file supplied via the *--reference_fasta_file* option.

**Output files:**

- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_sequencing_artifact_summary_metrics.tsv" - summary of the
  sequencing metrics calculation output.

Additional notes:

- Picard tools *AddOrReplaceReadGroups* and *CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics*
  are utilized during this step. The analysis is performed on tumor DNA BAM file
  without read stitching (separate R1 and R2 reads are investigated).
- The complete output of this analysis can be found in tool's results sub-directory
  "TMP/CSAM_FILES" if the parameter "--remove_temporary_files" is set to "False".

.. _S9-label:

9. Tumor DNA coverage and whitelist details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Enabled by default, triggered by tumor DNA sample, utilizing only the tumor DNA sample.**

**Functionality:** Creation of textual and graphical output detailing tumor DNA
sample coverage statistics at basepair, target, gene and sample resolutions.
Assembling additional information about genes and loci especially relevant for
currently available targeted treatment options in InPreD.

**Input files:**

- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/VariantMatching/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID]_MergedSmallVariants.genome.vcf"
  file for input tumor DNA sample (located automatically);
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/exon_targets/TSO500_exon_targets.bed";
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/whitelist_data/whitelist_gene_regions.txt".
- *internal TSOPPI container resource:* "/inpred/resources/whitelist_data/whitelist_transvar_processed.tsv";

**Output files:**

- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_coverage_details.tsv.gz" - coverage statistics for
  exonic regions targeted by the TSO500 DNA assay (on basepair, target and gene
  level);
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_coverage_histogram.tsv" - coverage histogram details
  for exonic regions targeted by the TSO500 DNA assay (providing information about
  the proportion of targeted areas with coverage >= X and <= X for all values
  of X relevant for the input DNA tumor sample);
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_coverage_plots.pdf" - graphical representation of selected
  information available in the \*coverage_details.tsv.gz and \*coverage_histogram.tsv
  files;
- "[tumor_DNA_sample_ID]_whitelist_details.tsv" - coverage and allele information
  for loci/variants and genes deemed relevant for targeted treatment options in InPreD.

Additional notes:

- The processed coverage statistics values are extracted from LocalApp's VCF file that
  reports coverage values and allelic composition for all assay-targeted bases,
  regardless of presence/absence of reportable small variant findings.
  The reported values should be understood as "coverage usable for LocalApp
  small varint calling" rather than total available coverage.

.. _S10-label:

10. Fusion and splice variant aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Enabled by default, triggered by tumor RNA sample, utilizing only the tumor RNA sample.**

**Functionality:** Aggregation of fusion and splice variant output generated
by the LocalApp. Reformatting into a table directly usable during quality
control of these variants.

**Input files:**

- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/RnaFusionMerge/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID]_AllFusions.csv" -
  file for tumor RNA sample (located automatically);
- "[LocalApp_output_directory]/Logs_Intermediates/RnaSpliceVariantCalling/[sample_ID]/[sample_ID].tsv" -
  file for tumor RNA sample (located automatically).

**Output files:**

- "[tumor_RNA_sample_ID]_fusion_and_splice_variant_candidates.tsv" - aggregated
  fusion and splice variant output (please see the file header for format details).

Additional notes:

- LocalApp's final fusion variant results are generated by merging 'filtered' 'Manta'
  caller output with the output of the 'SpliceGirl' caller. The latter caller generates
  splice variant calls as well, and it is sometimes questionable whether a given
  variant candidate should be interpreted as a fusion or rather as a splice variant.
- The aggregated information generated by TSOPPI allows for re-classification of the individual
  variants and/or for adjustment of their breakpoints. Values within field/column names prefixed
  with "Provisional\_" are meant to be checked; the corrected/final values can then
  be stored in corresponding "partner fields" without the "Provisional\_" prefix.
- Please note that the number of splice and fusion variant per sample is *highly*
  variable. Detailed manual QC of all variant candidates might in some cases not be feasible.
- IGV link files for fusion and splice variants are currently not generated by TSOPPI.

  --rna_tumor_pair_id [rtpid]                  Optional. Required if the LocalApp pipeline was run with the "Pair_ID" value specified for the matching RNA tumor sample (in that case, use the same value as was specified in the corresponding sample sheet).
  --rna_tumor_output_id [ortid]                Optional. RNA tumor sample ID that will be used in the output files (if not provided, the supplied '--rna_tumor_id' value will be used).
  --rna_tumor_localapp_run_directory [rrd]     Optional. Absolute path to main LocalApp output directory generated for the sequencing run with matching RNA tumor sample.  If not specified, value of parameter 'tumor_localapp_run_directory' will be used.

  Remaining input/output customization:
  --initial_port_number [ipn]                  Optional. The lowest port number that will be utilized for execution of IGV commands; integers following the initial port number will be used if multiple port numbers are necessary (the total number of necessary ports will correspond to the number of labels in the supplied '--port_number_labels' parameter value). Use integers larger than zero. (default value: 60151)
  --port_number_labels [pnl]                   Optional. String values that will be used to label the intended use/user of the individual port numbers. Muliple labels (separated by spaces and all together enclosed by quotes) can be supplied. (default value: "User1 User2")
  --igv_session_file [isf]                     Optional. Path to an IGV session file that should be used for viewing the identified variants. If supplied, the path will be used as-is for IGV command html links creation (the resulting links are meant for outside-the-container use only). (no default value)
  --enable_CSAM_check [True|False]             Optional. Enable running of Picard Tools` CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics utility on the tumor DNA sample. (default value: False)
  --variant_recurrence_table [vrt]             Optional. Absolute path to a variant recurrence table generated by the "update_variant_recurrence_table" TSOPPI tool. If supplied, the output small variant interpretation table will include the recurrence information. (default value: "NA")
  --localapp_version [lav]                     Optional. Version of the LocalApp pipeline that was used for generating the input of this tool. (default value: "2.2.0.12"; change to "2.0.1.4" when post-processing samples analyzed with an older LocalApp version)
  --inpred_nomenclature [True|False]           Optional. Set to "True" if the sample IDs follow InPreD nomenclature (all sample IDs are in format "PPPyyyy-Ann-Bpq-Cll"; please refer to the TSOPPI documentation for details). (default value: False)
  --remove_temporary_files [True|False]        Optional. A switch enabling/disabling removal of the "TMP" results sub-directory (located under the selected output directory) upon successful post-processing completion. (default value: True)
  --inpred_gene_whitelist [igw]                Optional. A list of genes for which coverage statistics will be generated. (default value: "NA" - an internal list will be used)
  --inpred_small_variant_whitelist [isvw]      Optional. A list of small variants for which coverage statistics will be generated. (default value: "NA" - an internal list will be used)
  --inpred_small_variant_blacklist [isvb]      Optional. A list of small variants which will not be deposited into the variant interpretation table, but instead into a separate blacklist table with the same format. (default value: "NA" - an internal list will be used)

Using IGV port commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the values of parameters "--initial_port_number N" (default value: 60151)
and "--port_number_labels 'U1 U2 .. Um'" (default value: "User1 User2"), the *process_patient_samples.sh*
tool creates sets of IGV command files (as described in the :ref:`S6-label` section)
for the following user-port combinations:

 - user "U1", port N;
 - user "U2", port N+1;
 - user "Um", port N+m-1.

The intention is to enable any combination of users to work simultaneously on the
same machine without disturbing each other with IGV command triggers (as each user can
reserve his/her own port for IGV use). The respective users need to start their
own IGV instances with the option "--port=X", where X is their dedicated port number.
(IGV v.2.8.0 has been extensively tested with this feature.)
